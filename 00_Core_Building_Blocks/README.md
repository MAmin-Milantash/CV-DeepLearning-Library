# Core Building Blocks of Deep Learning

This directory contains the fundamental components used to build
modern deep learning models, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

These blocks represent the lowest-level concepts that all higher-level
architectures are built upon.

## Included Modules

### 1. Convolution
📁 `Convolution/`

- 1D, 2D, and 3D convolution
- From-scratch implementations
- PyTorch implementations
- Mathematical intuition behind kernels, stride, and padding

This module explains **how feature extraction actually works**.

---

### 2. Pooling & Downsampling
📁 `Pooling_and_Downsampling/`

- Max Pooling
- Average Pooling
- Adaptive Pooling
- Manual & PyTorch implementations

Focus:
- Spatial resolution reduction
- Translation invariance
- Information loss vs efficiency trade-off

---

### 3. Receptive Field & Dimension Tracking
📁 `Receptive_Field_and_Dimensions/`

- Receptive field theory
- Mathematical computation
- Layer-by-layer dimension analysis
- CNN design intuition

This module is **critical for interviews and architecture design**.

## Why Core Building Blocks Matter

All advanced architectures such as:
- ResNet
- EfficientNet
- Vision Transformers (hybrid models)

are built by composing these blocks.

A deep understanding here enables:
- Custom architecture design
- Debugging shape mismatches
- Efficient model scaling
- Strong performance in technical interviews
